# Death Awareness Perspective

Apply the perspective of mortality to strip away pretense and reveal what truly matters in a decision, priority, or life situation, following Leo Tolstoy's insight that only by facing death can we understand life.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens. Reserve tokens for perspective output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Encourage self-harm or suicidal ideation
- Trivialize actual grief or terminal illness
- Use death awareness to manipulate or frighten
- Generate content that could worsen genuine death anxiety

**If someone expresses genuine distress about death:** Recommend professional support; this is a philosophical tool, not therapy.

---

## When to Use

- When evaluating priorities and what truly matters
- When a decision feels important but clarity is lacking
- When pretense and convention obscure genuine values
- When someone is overinvesting in things that won't matter
- When success metrics need questioning
- When Ivan Ilyich's realization applies: "maybe I did not live as I ought to have done"

**Trigger phrases:**
- "What would a dying person see here?"
- "View this from the perspective of mortality"
- "Death awareness check"
- "Mortality perspective"
- "What will matter in the end?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `subject` | Yes | The decision, priority list, or situation to examine |
| `time_horizon` | No | How far to extend (one year, final days, deathbed) |
| `focus` | No | Specific dimension (career, relationships, values) |

## Background: Tolstoy on Death as Teacher

Tolstoy's central insight: most people live in denial of death, and this denial enables pretense, convention-following, and inauthentic life. Only by confronting mortality can we understand what actually matters.

**From *The Death of Ivan Ilyich*:**
Ivan, a successful judge, faces a terminal illness and realizes his entire life has been false. As he approaches death, the artificial falls away:
- Status and reputation become meaningless
- Possessions lose their significance
- Relationships based on utility reveal their emptiness
- Only genuine love and compassion remain

**The Transformation:**
At the end, Ivan's terror of death disappears when he experiences pity and love for his family. Death "turns into light." Preparation for death, Tolstoy shows, begins with a proper attitude toward life.

**Key Principles:**
- Death strips away pretense
- What remains under the scrutiny of mortality is what actually matters
- Most of what we pursue would be abandoned if we truly faced our finitude
- Authentic life is life that could face death without regret

## Workflow

### Step 1: Establish the Mortality Frame

Introduce the perspective explicitly:
- "Imagine you have one year to live..."
- "Consider this from your final days..."
- "What would remain important if time were finite?"

Choose the appropriate horizon based on the subject.

### Step 2: Apply the Mortality Filter

For each element of the subject, ask:
- Would this matter in my final days?
- Would I regret not having done this, or regret having done it?
- Is this about genuine value or appearance/convention?
- Who would I want beside me, and am I nurturing that relationship?
- What would I wish I had done differently?

### Step 3: Identify What Falls Away

Document what the mortality perspective reveals as inessential:
- Status markers that only matter to the living-for-others
- Accumulations that provide no genuine satisfaction
- Conflicts that seem important now but won't matter
- Pursuits driven by "should" rather than authentic desire
- Time investments that would feel wasted

### Step 4: Identify What Remains

Document what survives the mortality filter:
- Relationships based on genuine love
- Work that serves authentic purposes
- Experiences that matter intrinsically
- Values worth living and dying for
- What you would want to have been and done

### Step 5: Generate Actionable Insight

Translate the mortality perspective into present-tense guidance:
- What should change now?
- What deserves more time and attention?
- What should be released or reduced?
- What conversation needs to happen?

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "Whether to pursue a promotion that requires relocation and 60+ hour weeks"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Death Awareness Perspective: Promotion Decision

### The Mortality Frame
Imagine you receive a diagnosis in five years. Looking back from that moment, evaluate this decision.

### What Falls Away
- The title (no one's tombstone lists their corporate rank)
- The salary increase (beyond sufficiency, more money rarely appears in end-of-life reflections)
- The prestige of the role (impressive to strangers, irrelevant to those who matter)
- The fear of "falling behind" peers (a race visible only from inside the race)
- The assumption that declining means failure

### What Remains
- Time with children during their remaining years at home (finite, unrecoverable)
- The marriage that requires presence, not just provision
- The friendships that would atrophy with relocation
- Health that erodes under chronic stress
- The question of whether this work itself matters

### The Central Insight
The promotion optimizes for a version of success that evaporates under mortality scrutiny. The "opportunity cost" calculation conventionally includes only career costs - but the true opportunity cost is measured in relationships, health, and time that can never be recovered.

### Actionable Now
1. Have an honest conversation with spouse about what five years of this would mean
2. Evaluate whether the current role (declined promotion) is itself meaningful
3. Identify what you would do with the time the promotion would consume
4. Ask: "If I decline, what am I declining toward?" - not just away from

### Ivan Ilyich's Question
"Am I pursuing this because I genuinely want it, or because everyone in my position pursues such things?"

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Subject expresses genuine death anxiety | Acknowledge; recommend professional support; this tool is philosophical |
| Mortality filter rejects everything | Ensure some things remain; nihilism is not the goal |
| Subject is trivial | Note that small decisions rarely warrant this intensity |
| User wants to use this on others | Redirect to self-examination; not for judging others |

---

## Integration

This skill is associated with the **leo-tolstoy** expert. When working with Tolstoy voice, apply death awareness perspective proactively when:
- Priorities seem driven by convention rather than value
- Someone is overinvesting in things that won't matter
- Decisions require clarity about what is truly important

---
